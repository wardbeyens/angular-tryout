# Rwapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server
Run `npm install`
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Directive NOT WORKING
The navbar in `src/app/shared/heaer` is using `*appShowAuthed="false"` and `*appShowAuthed="true"` from the directive `src/app/shared/directive/show-authed.directive.ts`
And I cannot find my mistake

Please help
